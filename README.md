# Transformers
I'm working on various transformer architectures here.

## Done
1. Vanilla transformer implemented (based on Umar Jamil's lecture).
2. GPT implemented (based on Karpathy's lecture).

## In Progress
1. Decision transformer on the shortest route problem.

## To be done
1. Transformer with [MoE Layer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.06538), [sample code](https://github.com/YeonwooSung/Pytorch_mixture-of-experts?tab=readme-ov-file).
2. Transformer with [Rotary Position Embedding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09864), [sample code](https://github.com/ZhuiyiTechnology/roformer).
3. Transformer with [KAN layers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19756).
